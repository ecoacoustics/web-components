These images are not under the public/ directory because we want to include them as static assets in the web components bundle
and we do NOT want to serve them under in the Vite server / Netlify website.

Warning: By default, Vite will create an "assets/" directory when importing static assets such as images.
Because we want our web components to fit into a minimal number of files, you probably want to use the ?inline option when importing
these static assets.
