    <title>Web Components - Empty Verification Grid</title>

    <p>
      This dev page tests a verification grid with no slotted content. This means that there are no decision buttons or
      tile templates.
    </p>

    <p>
      We should see that the verification grid is still functional, and that the skip button is still present, but there
      should be warning and errors displayed on the page indicating to the user that their verification grid is set up
      incorrectly.
