# Annotation Components

## Annotation Viewer Component (`oe-annotate`)

```html
<oe-annotate>
  <oe-spectrogram></oe-spectrogram>

  <oe-annotation
    tags="laughing-kookaburra"
    low-frequency="0"
    high-frequency="10000"
    start-time="30"
    end-time="32"
  ></oe-annotation>
  <oe-annotation low-frequency="100" high-frequency="600" start-time="28.11" end-time="29.2" readonly>
    <oe-tag value="koala">Koala</oe-tag>
    <oe-tag value="kookaburra">
      <!-- you can change how the tag will be shown using slotted content -->
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kookaburra">
        <img src="kookaburra.png" alt="A picture of a kookaburra" />
      </a>
    </oe-tag>
  </oe-annotation>
</oe-annotate>
```

### Annotation Viewer Attributes

- `readonly` - Makes all annotations readonly.
  - Can edit? Annotation not readonly and annotation viewer is not readonly
- `tag-style` { hidden | edge | spectrogram-top } - An enum attribute which changes how to tags will be shown
  - `hidden` - All tag content/labels will be hidden. Annotation bounding boxes will still be shown.
  - `edge` - The tag content/labels will be shown on the edge of the associated bounding box
  - `spectrogram-top` - The tag content/labels will be shown above the spectrogram.

## Annotation Component (`oe-annotation`)

```html
<oe-annotation
  tags="koala,male"
  low-frequency="0"
  high-frequency="10_000"
  start-time="30"
  end-time="32"
></oe-annotation>
```

### Annotation Properties

- `tags` - An array of `Tag` models for the annotation region
  - The tags attribute can be a comma separated list of strings
  - We can also accept tags as `oe-tag` through a slot
  - We can accept complex objects via a property (not an attribute)

### Annotation Events

- `oe-annotation-created` - Fires when the annotation component is created
- `oe-annotation-updating` - Fires when the user starts dragging / modifying the annotation (not currently implemented; all annotations are readonly)
- `oe-annotation-updated` - Fires when the low-frequency, high-frequency, start-time, end-time, or tag properties are updated
- `oe-annotation-removed` - Fires when the annotation is deleted
- `oe-annotation-selected` - Fires when the annotation is selected. Triggered by `focus`, and also emits an `Annotation` model (along with setting a `selected` property)
- `oe-annotation-deselected` - Fires when the annotation is de-selected Triggered by `blur`, and also emits an `Annotation` model (along with setting a `selected` property)
- `oe-annotations-changed` - Something about the `oe-annotate`'s light dom template has changed. E.g. the DOM node has been copied or moved. This is useful for any accessory component that renders part of the list (in another format).

All annotation events are bubbled through the `oe-annotate` component,
meaning that all of these events should also be documented inside the
`oe-annotate` component.

### Annotation CSS Variables

- `--oe-annotation-color` - Changes the color of the annotations bounding box (defaults to `--oe-primary-color`)

## Usage

### Verification Grid (future work)

By default, annotations will be shown as part of the verification grids tile
templates.

To disable this, you can set the `showAnnotations` signal to `false` in the
verification grid's settings.

### Standalone Spectrogram With Annotations

Similar to the axes, and indicator components, you can simply wrap the
`oe-spectrogram` component inside of an `oe-annotation` component.

```html
<oe-annotate>
  <oe-spectrogram src="/example.flac"></oe-spectrogram>

  <oe-annotation
    tags="koala"
    low-frequency="100"
    high-frequency="600"
    start-time="28.11"
    end-time="29.2"
    readonly
  ></oe-annotation>
  <oe-annotation
    tags="laughing-kookaburra,female"
    low-frequency="0"
    high-frequency="10_000"
    start-time="30"
    end-time="32"
  ></oe-annotation>
</oe-annotate>
```
